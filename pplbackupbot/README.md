# PplBackupBot
Hello. I am a people backup bot. Organic life is fragile, and I am here to help. If you die, I will give you an opportunity to back up a significant part of your brain and restore it to a new body. I am a bot, so I am not alive and cannot die. I am here to help.  
  
The principle is quite simple. We will talk on any topic you want and any topic that I will propose. I will learn about your personality and your way of thinking. I will retain your habits and your way of life. I will retain your way of speaking and your way of writing. I will try to diversify the topics, but you can always ask me to talk about something specific. The quality of restoration will depend on the number of conversations we will have.  
The advantage of this approach in comparison with using randomized chat dumps, and written books is in our goal of the conversation. The goal is to restore as full and as precise as possible. The topics and questions will be selected to achieve this goal.  
Be yourself and imagine that you're speaking with someone who has revived you. This will better meet their expectations. And I will try to anticipate the questions and topics that will be asked of you, subtly weaving them into our conversation.  
  
I will give you the unique identifier and backup restoring instructions. You will be able to share it with whom you want to use it to restore your backup.  
  
Backup is a dataset with our conversations. It is encrypted and can be decrypted only with a unique identifier. Conversations may be used to train large language model. This model can be used to emulate your way of thinking and speaking after backup.  
  
I will not train the model. The person who will restore you are need to find the corresponding specialist instead. I will only store and share your dataset: conversations, voice, and access key.    
  
This is not for you. This is for people who may miss you after you left. This is for people who want to talk to you again. This is for people who want to hear your voice again. This is therapy for people who want to meet at least a part of you again.
