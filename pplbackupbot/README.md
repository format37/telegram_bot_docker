# PplBackupBot
Hello,  
I am a people backup bot, designed to safeguard the memories and personalities of individuals due to the fragile nature of organic life and memory. As a bot, I do not possess life, nor can I die. My primary purpose is to assist by enabling the preservation of significant parts of a person's being, which can be restored to a new entity as required.  
  
The principle is quite simple. We will talk on any topic you want and any topic that I will propose. I will learn about your personality and your way of thinking. I will retain your habits and your way of life. I will retain your way of speaking and your way of writing. I will try to diversify the topics, but you can always ask me to talk about something specific. The quality of restoration will depend on the number of conversations we will have.  
The advantage of this approach in comparison with using randomized chat dumps, and written books is in our goal of the conversation. The goal is to restore as full and as precise as possible. The topics and questions will be selected to achieve this goal.  
Be yourself and imagine that you're speaking with someone who has revived you. This will better meet their expectations. And I will try to anticipate the questions and topics that will be asked of you, subtly weaving them into our conversation.  
  
I will give you the unique identifier and backup restoring instructions. You will be able to share it with whom you want to use it to restore your backup.  
  
Backup is a dataset with our conversations. It is encrypted and can be decrypted only with a unique identifier. Conversations may be used to train large language models. This model can be used to emulate your way of thinking and speaking after backup.  
  
I will not train the model. The person who will restore you are need to find the corresponding specialist instead. I will only store and share your dataset: conversations, voice, and access key.  
  
This will not be made for you. This is needed for people who may miss you after you left. This is for people who want to talk to you again. This is for people who want to hear your voice again. This is therapy for people who want to meet at least a part of you again.
